# NeuralNetwork-from-scratch
In this project, I implemented a simple two-layer neural network and trained it on the IRIS dataset.
## Installation
data_set= https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris <br/>
pip install scikit-learn <br/>
pip install numpy <br/>
pip install pandas <br/>
pip install matplotlib <br/>(these codes can have different versions)
## Overview
I try to code a simple neuron network with numpy and pandas libraries <br/>
